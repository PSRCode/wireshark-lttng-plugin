Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol
analyzer. It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a
microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard
across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies,
and educational institutions. Wireshark development thrives thanks to
the volunteer contributions of networking experts around the globe and
is the continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998.
